    description: `For more than 2 years I worked for adidas via Isobar Commerce Bulgaria. 
    Of course I cannot build such product alone, adidas online store was built and continue improving by many 
    professionalist, and I can be only proud that I worked for such client and did a massive impact. <br /><br /> 
    I was the first developer from Bulgaria who joined their new team 'Glass'. We actually rebuilded the whole online store from scratch, using
    React.js, Node.js and Salesforce Commerce Cloud. The role included very close work with product people of adidas, QA and other developers. 
    My main participation was on /release-dates calendar and all listing pages (as /search, /men-shoes, /women-originals-clothing and etc.). 
    This includes building the pages from scratch, adding more features, tests, releasing the product and supporting it.`,
